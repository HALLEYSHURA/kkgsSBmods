    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer

So I hit upon a genius idea! If the Resistance and the Miniknog could just talk it out, then maybe things could get smoothed over. I'm sure the Miniknog aren't the villains the Resistance thinks they are, if only they'd get to know them. So I tunnelled out of my room and found the nearest Miniknog platoon.",

"Filled with positivity, I led them to the Resistance hideout and told them that if they didn't sort out their differences, I'd knock their heads together. So smart! Well, I think it went okay! I didn't stick around to find out for sure, of course, I had to meet back up with my Greenfinger friend, but I saw them all marching together through the town square as we left."
