    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer

The Glitch call their free-thinking peers 'Outcasts', but there are certain Glitch who are allocated identities with permission, and thus remain in their chosen role. For example, I found a Glitch whose job it is to gaze wistfully up at the stars and talk about 'the good old days'.",

    "Another Glitch, a master chef, remains in her job role due to the fact 'she makes the best pancakes'. Then there are law enforcement officers, mysterious kung fu masters, and town criers. There are even kings and lords! Very interesting indeed."
