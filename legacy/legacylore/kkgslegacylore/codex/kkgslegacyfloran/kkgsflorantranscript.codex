    "(Transcribed by Hylotl prisoner #0451)

Another prisoner needs stabbing. Stab. Floran prisoner. Lost his mind. 

(The Floran guard mutters something vaguely menacing at me)

Cut him down. Return him to soil. Floran rest.

(Floran guard shakes a spear in my direction. I narrowly avoid it.)",

    "His cocoon-kin shall be notified. 

His dying screams will haunt me to the end of my days. As I lay down to sleep, those blood-curdling cries will be forever with me. Such suffering.

(I have added the last portion myself, but I'm sure that's what the Floran guard meant by his departing, unintelligible grunts and hisses.)"
