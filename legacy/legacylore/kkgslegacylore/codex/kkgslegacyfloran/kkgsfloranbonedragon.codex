The Florans, the hunters of great prey, would dismiss the idea of dragons as mere folly. Mostly because if they encountered one, they'd be too busy killing it to care about what it is.

But dragons were real, once. That is, if the bones of some gargantuan beasts truly are of draconic origin.",

"To lure a dragon goes as such: lay down the right bait, and the creature swoops in from the skies, scorching all in its path. Mindless, murderous, with seemingly no goal other than utter ruin, it's truly a sight to behold.

"Lately, there have been reported sightings of dragons soaring through the skies once more, their bones brought back to life to once again reap destruction.

"Perhaps it is the work of those strange, winged demons sighted on distant planets. Or maybe the unusual Agarans, the mushroom people who till the earth?
