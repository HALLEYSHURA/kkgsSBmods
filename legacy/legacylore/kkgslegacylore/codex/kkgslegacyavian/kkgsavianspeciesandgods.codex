    "After the dawn of FTL space travel, when many species began to co-habit, or engage with one another, the scope for studying theology grew exponentially. It is endlessly fascinating to learn about other species' approaches to spirituality and worship, and how they vary.",
	
	"The Apex, for instance, worship no god, with their leader Big Ape having all but achieved deification through demand and control.

The Hylotl worship nature in all its facets, their gods lacking anthropomorphism and instead being very much conceptual.",

"The Glitch speak of their creators, an unknown progenitor race who the robots regard with awe.

The Novakids and Florans do not seem to worship any god.

Then there are the humans.",
	
"We have but one god: Kluex. Humans worship many gods, and often this method of worship brings the species into conflict with one another. An outsider can see the similarities between the factions, but the humans seemingly cannot.",

"What is also unusual about human belief is that their gods seem to exist based on supposition and rumour, rather than any factual evidence. To worship beings so removed, so speculative, seems entirely alien to me."
