    "For as long as we can remember, our temples have contained sacrificial altars. Our god, Kluex, is merciful and just, and rarely demands sacrifice. But when he does, we comply. The blessed spilled blood fertilizes the earth, allowing its power to transfer into the sky, keeping the heavens of the Aether alive.",
	
	"Many of the sacrifices are devout Avians, willing to give their lives for the cause. Some, however, are Grounded, or even on occasion other species. If the sacrifice resists, there is a method of sedation which we employ, a cocktail of nectar, sugar and pussplum juice. It serves to pacify and calm the sacrifice, leaving them ready to embrace Kluex."
