    "Arriving at an Apex town always fills me with sadness. The Apex plight is not unlike the Glitch's, but a thousand times worse. Here, the Miniknog have broken the population, reducing them to mindless slaves. Put a foot wrong, and the Miniknog are on you. Do nothing wrong, and chances are they will be anyway.",
	
	"Worse yet, I hear rumours of mysterious labs on remote planets, of horrific experiments and terrifying beasts. There's also talk of 'Big Ape', a foreboding Apex figure depicted on posters and television screens, whose name the citizens mutter in hushed, reverent tones."
