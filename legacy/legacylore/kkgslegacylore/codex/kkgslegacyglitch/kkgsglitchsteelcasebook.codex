Moonlight bounces off granite walls as I walk the streets of this small Glitch village. My quarry, unknown for now, skulks silently in the night.

Murder. A murdered Glitch, mechanical parts strewn across oil-stained cobbles. His cold metal body lying in a repair shop somewhere, waiting for justice.",

"He never left the village, they tell me, which points to one thing. The killer was someone close to him. A wolf in steel clothing. An Outcast in our midst.

Hit the streets, asked around. For a while, nothing to go on. Then a breakthrough. Our murdered Glitch has been working a certain role more often than is usual. Window cleaner. One particular house, in fact. Often at night. Curious.",

"I stood outside the building, the sun gleaming off the freshly-polished glass, and realised I was metres from the crime scene, from where our victim was found. I'll pay the house a visit. See what I can dig up.",

Leeron is not the Glitch I'm looking for. I conducted numerous interviews with her, and she is not self-aware. Her windows, she claims, just require washing very frequently due to being downwind from a logging mill. I have confirmed this.",

"However, as I returned from the logging mill, brooding and moody, I was pulled into a dark alley by an unknown assailant. I knew the broad was trouble as soon as I laid eyes on her. She had that look, that self-aware stance, but also one of desperation. 

'I need your help,' she said, as my fingers twitched over my mace.",

Just another tragic story, another Outcast looking to escape being repurposed. She'd heard about me, heard who I was. Sometimes, this double life gets on top of me, but other times, like last night, when I save a life, it's all worth it.",

"She'd killed our Glitch, of course. He'd been cleaning her windows and observed her engaging in Outcast behaviour. She killed him and moved his body to another location, the place he was always seen.",

"I made sure she left the city safely, and promised to cover up her crime. It's an easy job. I'll do what I always do, and close the case by saying a Floran did it. Besides, the victim should be out of the repair bay in a couple more days. No harm done."
