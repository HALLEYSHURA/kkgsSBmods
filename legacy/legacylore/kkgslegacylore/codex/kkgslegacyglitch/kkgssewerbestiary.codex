    "THE GROWFLY

Extremely aggressive, the Growfly is a fly-like creature of epic proportions (at least, compared to the average house fly). The Glitch tell me that it was created when a fly and a slightly bigger fly got into a random teleportation accident, although this does not account for its huge size. Perhaps there is something in the waters of the sewer it calls its home.",

"The Growfly is not found elsewhere, but its mere existence poses an interesting question: How can we get hold of one so the Floran can fight it?",

"THE MECHARACHNID

Unable to deal with the Growfly, and unwilling to accept an offer of a dozen Floran hunters being dispatched into the sewer, the Glitch created a giant mechanical spider - part creature, part robot, it stalks the sewers looking for the Growfly.",

"However, the Glitch did not consider that their creation was evenly matched with its quarry, and now the two are locked in an everlasting battle, neither gaining the upper hand for long. However, the Mecharachnid has managed to kill plenty of other things, including its original creators, so there's that.",

"THE PO

There are also stories of a mysterious creature lurking in the sewers. A creature formed entirely of waste. Bodily waste. This distasteful beast is less dangerous than it is disgusting, and travellers are advised not to get too close.",

"The beast seemingly can't be killed, simply reforming eventually after destruction. My Glitch contacts shuddered as they told me of this creature, and I do not blame them. I'm not sure I'd even task a Floran with dealing with this mess."
