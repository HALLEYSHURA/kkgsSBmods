    "Never have I felt so alone. I am surrounded by my Glitch kin, and yet I know deep down I am an outcast. At night, I sleep, and I dream. Dream! Glitch do not dream. I dream of escape, of journeying beyond the stars, of carving a life out for myself, away from this drudgery.",

    "I almost caught myself second-guessing a directive out loud today. My thought process is changing. It terrifies me. I have desires, now. I question things. Who created us? Where do we come from? What ARE we?",

	"I can feel myself slowly disconnecting from my coding, and while this scares me, there is a feeling of comfort there too.

I am alone, but I know there are others like me, out there. I know I will find them."
