    "The outcast Glitch, desperate to strengthen their numbers, came up with a plan. Famous outcast Platinum Ace approached a particularly volatile Glitch scientist, and together they drew up blueprints for a new form of Glitch; a better, more powerful being.

Thus, Fatal Circuit was born. Initially, everything was okay. Then two seconds passed and Fatal Circuit malfunctioned, trying to kill every living being in the immediate area.",
	
	"After a lengthy chase, Platinum smashed Fatal Circuit with a handy nearby hammer, and inspected the wreckage. She was horrified to discover that the scientist had transplanted a Floran brain into the robot, thus rendering it uncontrollably murderous.

Platinum buried the plans in the sands of a barren desert planet, hoping that Fatal Circuit would never be recreated."
