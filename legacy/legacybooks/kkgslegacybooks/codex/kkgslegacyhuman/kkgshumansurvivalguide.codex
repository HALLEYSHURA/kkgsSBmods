    "So you want to survive long enough to see your first sunset, right? Good luck. Seriously. There are some handy tips and tricks that you might want to consider before rushing headlong into the wilderness. So many adventurers have set out filled with bravado, only to be decimated as soon as night falls. That won't be you, right? Right?",

    "First up, and this one's important: TOOLS TOOLS TOOLS. Before you go charging into alien lands, go grab yourself a handy flashlight, several lengths of rope, and a drill or pickaxe to get the resources you'll need. Trust me, you'll need them. They'll make all the difference between survival and being eaten alive by sentient radishes.",

    "Making a shelter is pretty handy, too. The nights are dark and full of terrors, and also things that don't LOOK terrifying but really are. Be sure to build a base with a campfire and storage, even if it looks like a mud hut full of wooden boxes. You'll thank us when the monsters are clawing at your door, and you're inside, safe, stocked, and not freezing to death.",
	
	"Stock up on bandages and medicine; they'll get you out of a tight spot. It's not always possible to sleep and recuperate, so a good supply of bandages can be a life-saver. Everyone knows bandages can heal every type of injury, so there's no excuse to be unprepared.",

    "Don't forget to upgrade! You might THINK you look the bomb swinging a mouldy stick and wearing your basic rags, but your foes won't think the same. They'll think you look silly, and then eat you. Get yourself some better weapons and armour before taking on more dangerous beasts.",

    "Finally; BIRDS ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. Ever. Even if they look cute, they'll kill you as soon as you turn your back. All birds. Not Avians, of course. They're lovely. I'm talking proper flying, spitting, burning birds. You know the type. Never trust a bird."
