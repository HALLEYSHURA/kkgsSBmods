    "When Big Ape was just a little ape, his home village was attacked by beaked black-and-white bandits from beyond the stars. These vile penguin pirates set everything to the torch, and Big Ape was forced to watch as his village burned.",

    "Big Ape swore revenge, and revenge he got. As the penguins were leaving in their space pirate ship, he fired a grappling hook at them and pulled the ship down to earth, using nothing but his strength. After that, no penguins went near his village ever again."
