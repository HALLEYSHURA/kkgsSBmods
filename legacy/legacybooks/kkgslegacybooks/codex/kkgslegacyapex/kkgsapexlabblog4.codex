    "We are to be visited by the Administrator soon. This is unprecedented. The atmosphere in the lab is one of excitement and terror. None of us have ever seen him in person before! I have to admit, I get a fanboy shiver every time I think about it.",

    "In other news, Doctor Lax has become more withdrawn, working away in her experiment chamber at all hours of the day and night. I've had no opportunity to take a look. I'm almost relieved.",
	
    "The Formula F test subjects are producing great results. At least, that's what I'm told. I like to think I have a great understanding of my work, but even then, I can't fathom exactly what's going on here. It doesn't help that half the results are redacted.",

    "I feel like my role here is to press buttons and flip switches, and nothing more. Doctor Lax, when she bothers to emerge from her test chamber at all, simply snatches the results from my hand and stalks off. It's all very disconcerting.",

    "Lax has been especially jumpy lately, too. She's surrounding herself with Miniknog guards, even having them search us each day as we enter the lab. It's no longer an enjoyable working environment. Still, at least we have the Admin's visit to look forward to."
