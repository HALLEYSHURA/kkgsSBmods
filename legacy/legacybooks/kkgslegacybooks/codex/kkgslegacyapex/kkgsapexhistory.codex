    "From as far back as Apex history can be traced, all that is known is the rule of the benevolent Miniknog and the majestic Big Ape. Of course, Apex history only reaches back a few hundred years, due to a series of accidental fires, explosions and rogue mech accidents which destroyed all of the archives ever.",

    "The Miniknog assure the populace, however, that their order has been in charge since the dawn of time, and will continue to be in charge until the last star supernovas. Any Apex who steps out of line, says the wrong thing, eats the wrong banana or looks at one of the many hidden cameras in a funny way will be subjected to Miniknog Therapy, designed to improve the species. In fact, all Apex should volunteer for this. Sign up now."
