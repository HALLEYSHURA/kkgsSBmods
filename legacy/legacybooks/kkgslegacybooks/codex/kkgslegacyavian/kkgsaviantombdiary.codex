    "DAY 1

Today, my job begins. A job that many Avians do not know exists. I am the keeper of a tomb - a very special tomb - and it almost feels sacrilegious to write down why. But this journal is for my eyes only; supposedly within this tomb resides Harspex, one of the Sunborn.",
	
"I have seen her tomb, once, when I was given the tour by a member of the Council. It is hidden deep within the bowels of this place, down hidden passageways and behind secret doors. I am not sure I will ever find it again, as is the intention.",

"DAY 8

I've scoured this tomb from top to bottom, read every inscription, inspected every jar, opened every sarcophagus. I have nothing left to do. I've been here a week.",

"DAY 12

I caught an intruder today. A young Apex, dressed in black, creeping his way through the tunnels and corridors until I put a stop to that. I knocked the apeman unconscious and searched him. His clothing bore the insignia of the Miniknog.",

"What could the Miniknog be after in an Avian tomb? Talk says that Big Ape is the richest being in the universe, so what could they possibly want to steal? I attempted to question the Apex, but before I could react he ate a poisoned banana he'd stowed in his sleeve, and was lost to me. I stored his body in a sarcophagus. I hope nobody notices.",

"DAY 23

I heard noises today, deep within the tomb. I followed the sounds through darkened corridors, my torch flickering shadows on the wall, but I could not trace the source. I wondered, for a while, if another Miniknog agent had infiltrated my sanctuary. But the noise was different; not something trying to get in, but something trying to get out.", 

"I began to pull the lids off the sarcophagi, disturbing the bodies within, searching for one who may have been buried alive. Of course, the crumbling bones were unmoving. Yet still the sound persisted. A scraping, scrabbling sound. I will investigate further.",

"DAY 28

I am losing my mind. I search and search but the sound continues. But no longer do I search for the source; I search for the entrance to the Sunborn tomb, for I know it is from there the sound originates. I believe one of Kluex's harbingers has awakened, and longs for release. 

I'll tear this place apart if I must."
