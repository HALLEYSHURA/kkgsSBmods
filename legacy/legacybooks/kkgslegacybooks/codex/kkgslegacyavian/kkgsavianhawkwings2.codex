    "I was visited by the Stargazers themselves. They have heard of me, of my work. And so, too, has Kluex. I was summoned.

Let me just say I was wrong. I have been wrong this whole time. I am a fool and a rogue. Glory to Kluex. I have gazed upon our lord with my own eyes, and I know now the truth. Grounded, it is not too late! Repent, come back to the flock. Kluex will forgive you. Do not doubt his power."
