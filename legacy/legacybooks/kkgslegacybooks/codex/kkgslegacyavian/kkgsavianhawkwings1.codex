    "While the Flightless blindly follow the teachings of the Stargazers, those of us who are enlightened - grounded, if you will - question it. Many of us, in fact, are of the opinion that Kluex does not even exist.

What evidence is there? What SCIENTIFIC evidence? Proof. That's what the universe revolves around. There is little proof that Kluex exists, other than statues and carvings depicting his supposed appearance.",
	
"On a distant desert planet lies the Great Sovereign Temple, said to house treasures of the god. A lonely, desolate place. Fit for a god? I do not believe so. If you ask me, that space station is a spy satellite. Watching us. Recording our personal data. Sending reports to the Stargazers about what we do, think, eat, drink. They're watching us all.",
	
"It is possible that Avian religious nobility took some tips from the Apex; there are startling similarities between Kluex and Big Ape, the ruler of the Apex. They are both mysterious figures, and they both rule. Having researched Avian history, I came to the conclusion that it's entirely possible the Stargazers had met with Big Ape in the past.",

"Perhaps this is where the idea for Kluex came from. Perhaps the Great Temples, the Stargazers' spy satellites, are simply filled with the Miniknog's mind-reading technology. The Clipped Council extol the virtues of prayer, but how can Kluex hear our prayers? You know what DOES have super-hearing? A SPY SATELLITE. That's right. Every time you pray, that spy satellite records your words, documents them, and saves them for use against you.",

"I contacted the Miniknog for comment on this. Transcribed below is Big Ape's reply:

'Big Ape, here. Kluex, you say? A god? An Avian god? Big Ape is not familiar with this individual. But Big Ape will be happy to challenge your god Kluex to a no-holds-barred cage match, to prove ape superiority once and for all. Any time, any place, anything goes. The Miniknog are always ready.'

It remains to be seen whether Kluex will accept this offer."
