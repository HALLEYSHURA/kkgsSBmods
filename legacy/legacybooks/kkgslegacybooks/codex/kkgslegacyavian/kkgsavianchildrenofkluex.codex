    "There is a species, in the far corners of the universe, which many are aware of. Small Avian-like creatures, waddling beasts with beaks and flightless wings. They operate as space pirates, rogues and renegades. Legend tells that they were cousins to the mighty Sunborn, but were forcibly cast from the Aether due to their wicked ways; the first Flightless.",
	
	"Kluex laments the loss of his children, and their spiral into darkness. But they will not embrace him, will not return to the fold. And thus, it is any good Avian's duty to report a space pirate penguin sighting to the nearest authorities."
