    "DAY 1

Finally, the day has come. I have been chosen. Chosen to begin my training, to become what I have always aspired to be. Strangers and friends have walked this path before me, and they have all failed. I will not.",

"I've prepared for this. All my life I've prepared. My body is at its peak; I can endure the Ascendant training, I can display glory and honour, and I can please Kluex. I know it. My family supports me, my friends support me, the only thing left is to get my head down and do this.",
	
"DAY 2

Physical training began today. Myself and five other Avian youths. Obstacle courses, races, all manner of challenges. At the end of the day, we were awarded a score. I came top of my class! I was so proud.",

"As expected, my peers accepted their loss graciously, and we all retired to the mess hall for dinner. It was a pleasant feast; a reward for our first day of the trials, perhaps. I feel so at home here, amongst likeminded Flightless, no talk of the Grounded, just devotion to Kluex.",

"DAY 3

Last night I lay awake in my bunk. Suddenly, rough hands grabbed me. A hand pressed to my mouth. 'Stop making us look bad,' a voice whispered. It was too dark to see my antagonists. I tried to fight back, but they held me down.",

"The next day I woke up and all my clothes had been shredded. Clearly I was mistaken to trust my peers. Their facade is just that; a false friendship masking severe competitiveness. Well, if that's how they're going to play it, I can play rough too. I was not going to fall back on my family's money, but needs must...",

"DAY 4

Our Clipped Council liaison came by today, and a well-placed bribe ensured I won't have to be sharing a room with the others. No more worrying about late-night visits. Next, I sent word to my man outside the village; he is to deliver a message of great importance.", 

"Then, our mental training began. I outclassed the others with ease, as I knew I would. My mind is the sharpest it has ever been. I could see them staring at me, angrily, just willing me to succeed, planning what they'd do to me when I did. They're going to have a rude awakening.", 

"DAY 5

Finally, my contraband package arrived. Delivered in the dead of night by my manservant. It did not disappoint. The Floran Greenfingers truly are masters when it comes to alchemical formulas. I took one sip and already I could feel my strength boosting, my body hardening.", 

"Tomorrow, we begin sparring practise. I pity the foolish Avians who will get in my way. They're going to experience a side of me they've never seen before. A dark, angry side. And it will be glorious.", 

"DAY 6

Never before have I felt so powerful, so unstoppable. We took to the gladiatorial arena, and I threw down against opponent after opponent. When I was done, my entire class lay sprawled on the floor around me, groaning, looking at me with malice in their eyes. They are weak, pathetic.", 

"My joy was short-lived, however. I returned to the dorms to find my secret stash disturbed, my bottles of precious enhancement gone. A red feather sat in their place. An accident or a defiant message? I knew who was responsible. Larbeaks, perhaps the strongest Avian in the class besides me. She's been gunning for me since day one.", 

"DAY 7

To become a Sunborn, one must be cunning as well as strong. Without my formula, Larbeaks has an edge over me. Perhaps she will take it herself. I cannot risk this. My manservant has been sent off-world, to make contact with a certain Helion.", 

"Dealing with Helions is always risky business. My mother would often hire one of these creatures to keep political rivals in their place, but this is my first time. I admit, I feel something of a thrill.", 

"DAY 8

My manservant returned. Well, my manservant WAS returned. Thankfully, none of my peers saw me take delivery of the crate, or dispose of the remains. I was expecting this, of course; Helions are known to shoot the messenger. It proves that we the clients are committed, knowing we are sending a trusted employee to their doom.", 

"Barbaric but necessary. So my contract was accepted, and now I have to wait. Helions are known for their promptness. The assassin could be here any day. Maybe they already are. Their stealth capabilities are unrivalled. It's somewhat disconcerting.", 

"Larbeaks will regret messing with me, during her split-second realisation. I've told the Helion to ensure she knows where the hit came from. I will not be trifled with.", 

"DAY 9

It is done. Larbeaks is no more. Nobody suspects a thing. And yet I am shaken, concerned. You see, the Helion visited me after the kill. This is unheard of. Almost never do the Helion reveal themselves to their clients. And yet, I woke up in the night to feel a hand on my shoulder.", 

"The Helion was not what I expected. He was soft-spoken, calm. His name is Hish'eth and he said he knew my mother. That he'd been there when she died. I asked him if that meant what I thought it meant. He shook his head, and I thought I could detect a sadness in his eyes.", 

"He asked about the Ascension. I explained it all to him, about my journey to become a Sunborn. The Helion laughed and accused me of hubris. 'Why risk your life to achieve godhood when you can become a god of your own making?' he asked. I thought about the Celestial Tower, about the fall, about the numerous Avians who did not fly.", 

"DAY 10

Hish'eth was right. Why settle for joining Kluex, IF I survive? Once I leap off the tower, I have no way to give myself an advantage. It all rests in the hands of Kluex. I don't like those odds. I control my own destiny.", 

"Hish'eth gave me a datapad with co-ordinates on it. I believe it to be a sector somewhere in Hylotl space. 'Go here,' he said. 'Go here and follow your true destiny' - and then he was gone.", 

"Finding a spaceship won't be hard. Getting off-planet won't be hard. I have the finances, and I have the means. Something in my heart is telling me that THIS is my destiny; not to rot in a Sunborn tomb, but to carve my own throne in my image.", 

"I will become an unstoppable force. And the universe shall know the name Thornwing."
