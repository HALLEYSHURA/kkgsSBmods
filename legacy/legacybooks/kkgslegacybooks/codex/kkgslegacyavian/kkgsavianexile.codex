    "I was fortunate enough to meet with a member of the Clipped Council some time ago. We shared talk, stories, and eventually a bottle of particularly potent pussplum wine. This loosened the Avian's tongue even more, and I was able to ask her about the Grounded, and how her people deal with those who defy Kluex.",

    "Many are simply exiled from their villages, she told me, occasionally even hounded off-planet if their heresy is grand enough. Others, however, are subjected to rather barbaric practices.",
	
	"One such practice is dipping the heretic in a vat of tar-like liquid, which solidifies over their feathers, turning their plumage into what is essentially stone. It's a largely symbolic gesture, seeing as the Avians cannot fly, but one which serves to sufficiently shame the subject.

She stressed, repeatedly, that this behaviour was no longer endorsed by either the Stargazers or the Council."
