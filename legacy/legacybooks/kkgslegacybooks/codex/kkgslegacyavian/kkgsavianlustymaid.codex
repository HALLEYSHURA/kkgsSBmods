    "Human Translator's note: our most accurate translation of the Avian word \"lusty\" (which is, of course, pronounced with an audible 'squawk') approximates, in our language, to \"flatulent\". This stage reading is the best example we have of the budding Avian performance culture, which seems to only have started after first contact with ours. However, it is important to note that this transliteration is from a damaged document, so large parts are missing.",
	
	"SCENE: Ext., Celestial Tower. Grants-You-Wings, an Avian priestess, is lecturing a group of young Avians on the afterlife.

Grants-You-Wings: \"...and as you hit the ground, your soul will ascend into the Aether, to be judged by Kluex himself.\"
First Student: \"But what if we don't die when we hit the ground?\"
Grants-You-Wings: \"Then you have been chosen to stay on the mortal plane to continue to serve him.\"",
	
	"First Student: \"That makes sense- hey, what's that smell..?\"

OFF-STAGE: An ominous rumbling/fluttering sound shakes the stage.

Grants-You-Wings: \"My apologies. I have been very lusty recently.\""
