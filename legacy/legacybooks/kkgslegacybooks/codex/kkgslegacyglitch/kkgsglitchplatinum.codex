    "More and more these days, we're called into these sewers to help other Outcasts escape from the city above. We've got our routine down; if it wasn't for the giant fly, and the... other things, it'd be completely smooth. But once we exit the tunnels, and I see those Glitch relax and understand their freedom... well, that makes up for everything.",

    "It has been many years since I became capable of free will, and I am still amazed by how liberated, how truly free we are. They strut up their in their castles, swinging their maces and polishing their silverware. Meanwhile, we reach for the stars, we build our own constructs and advance the species. Who, truly, are the outcasts now? We have surpassed our kin in so many ways.",

    "And yet, still we are exiled, steel pariahs crawling through sewer and swamp just for the chance to truly live. Those who comform to their programming and enforce the status quo are celebrated, while we who desire change and progress are forced to wade through stinking waters just to avoid persecution. 

What kind of community, what kind of family, would leave their kin feeling this way?",

"But I can feel it in my metal - one day, maybe not today, or tomorrow, but soon, we will liberate our people. We will introduce the Glitch to choice, to technological advancement, to free thought. We will become something more than mindless automatons, and the Outcasts will be outcast no more."
