    "Dear Deckard,

Thank you so much for getting me to safety. I knew I was right to trust you. The Outcast community here are wonderful, and speak very highly of you. You've saved many Glitch lives.

Should you ever decide to join us and retire in safety, the door is always open.

Thoughts always,
Platinum"
